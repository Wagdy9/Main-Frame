I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inquire about the status of my onboarding process. As you may recall, I completed the qualification process five months ago and have not received any updates since then.<br>

I am excited about the opportunity to join your team and would appreciate any information you can provide regarding the status of my application. If there are any additional steps I need to take or documents I need to provide, please let me know.<br>

Thank you for your time and consideration</div>
