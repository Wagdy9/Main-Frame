	<p>A "Hello, World!" program is generally a computer program
	 that ignores any input and outputs or displays a message similar to 
	 "Hello, World!". A small piece of code in most general-purpose programming
	  languages
	 this program is used to illustrate a language's basic syntax. "Hello, World!" 
	 programs are often the first a student learns to write in a given language,
	  and they can also be used as a sanity check to ensure computer software intended
	   to compile or run source code is correctly installed, and that its operator understands 
	   how to use it
